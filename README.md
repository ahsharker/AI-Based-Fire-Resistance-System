# AI-Based-Fire-Resistance-System
Fire accident destroys lives and makes a long-lasting economic and structural losses. Rate of occurring fire accidents is increasing day by day as the usage of fire sensitive products is also increasing. Accidents and losses by fire accidents mainly happen because of proper steps and responses during accident. To overcome the issues, we are coming with a solution based on computer vision, deep learning and AI.
We are going to propose a system which will be connected to the admin panel where switches of fire-alarm system will be kept connected. Base on temperature mapping, whenever a temperature will cross the threshold an automatic message will activate the fire-alarm system. Besides, our system will predict when next fire accidents may occur. If there is already fire in the place, then cameras will send the image data of fire and smoke of the affected place.
